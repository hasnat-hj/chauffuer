         Through our
        Platform, Drivers have the opportunity to receive transport requests and
        the option to be contracted by potential passengers looking for a
        transport service. We are an intermediary booking service platform
        whereby Transport Services may be booked by Passengers from Drivers. By
        means of Local Licence Authorities, we are authorised. We have an office
        established in Kent where all booking data shall be kept. We offer the
        service of connecting Passengers with Drivers to move around between
        locations of their choice. For this purpose, your identification details
        will be transmitted to the Passengers every time the Passenger searches
        for a Transport Service through the Chauffeur Cars App. Passengers will
        be provided with your first name and surname, telephone number, image
        photo, your vehicle registration number, type and specifications of
        vehicle, location, and performance rating. As soon as you start the
        Chauffeur Cars App and set yourself as available, your location can be
        identified by all Passengers and other users. The respective
        geo-location of the Passenger will be specified after the Passenger
        hails you through the Chauffeur Cars App. We do not provide
        transportation services but act solely as a channel of communication
        between you and the Passenger. From the point at which you accept to
        transport a Passenger, you enter into a direct contractual relationship
        with the Passenger that has booked you. It is up to you to offer
        Transport Services which may be scheduled through use of the Chauffeur
        Cars App and to comply with all applicable legislation, including
        compulsory insurance legislation and passenger safety. We have no
        responsibility or liability whatsoever for any claims, suits, losses,
        damages, expenses, consequential loss or otherwise, arising out of or in
        connection with or in respect of any death or injury to any person
        whatsoever, and in respect of any loss or damage to any property
        whatsoever, which may arise in relation to a Transport Service.
        Consequently you, and not us, are responsible and liable for any such
        claims, suits, losses, damages, expenses, consequential loss or
        otherwise, arising out of or in connection with or in respect of any
        death or injury to any person whatsoever, and in respect of any loss or
        damage to any property whatsoever, which may arise in relation to a
        Transport Service. Neither are we responsible or liable for damages you
        may incur while providing a Transport Service. The information that we
        disclose is based on the information provided to us by the Users. As

        and are covered by a motor insurance policy as required by Law and other
        insurance that may be deemed prudent in relation to the provision of the

        licences and documents, approvals or other registrations, policies and
        certifications that may be necessary for the provision of the Transport
        Service in terms of all applicable laws and regulations. You are to
        always act professionally in the provision of the Transport Service and
        to respect the Passengers making use of the Transport Service. You are
        also to act in the best interest of the Passenger and ensure that you
        take the most cost-efficient route for the Passenger unless otherwise

        person to accompany you or otherwise make use of the Transport Service

        Services. You confirm that you have all the necessary licences where
        necessary.
        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">7. PASSENGER FEES For every Transport Service provided to</h3> 
        Passengers accepted on the Platform you are to charge the Passenger Fee
        based the fee, as determined by the Chauffeur Cars App. Any request for
        corrections to the Passenger Fee must be submitted via the Chauffeur
        Cars App. We reserve the right to adjust the Passenger Fee if we
        determine a violation or a technical error that affects the Passenger
        Fee. In justified circumstances such as in case of fraud or complaints,
        we may reduce or cancel the Passenger Fee. We may issue an invoice on
        your behalf to the Passenger to compensate you any Passenger Fees,
        contractual penalties or other fees that may be due to you by a
        Passenger. The invoice will be made available to you via your Account.
        The Passenger Fee is paid either directly to you or through the Payment
        Method system as further detailed below. If the Passenger has opted to
        pay you directly, then it is your responsibility to collect the
        Passenger Fee. We will send a notice of debt to the Passenger on your
        behalf if he fails to effect payment. Such act is not to be construed as
        an obligation on our part to compensate the Passenger Fee not paid by
        the Passenger. If a Passenger justifiably refuses to pay the Passenger
        Fee due to inaccurate information in the Chauffeur Cars App, we will not
        reimburse you for such expenses. We will provide Passengers following
        provision of Transport Service with a statement showing the company
        name, if applicable, place of business, VAT number, name, and surname of
        Driver together with image photo, car registration number, details about
        the journey including date, time, start and end locations and Passenger
        Fee paid. You may request Passengers to pay a penalty in the amount
        established in our Chauffeur Cars App and request compensation more than
        such penalty amount from Passengers if Passengers damage the vehicle or
        its interiors negligently. We will endeavour to collect the penalty from
        the Passenger on your behalf if the Passenger fails to do so upon
        request. This is not to be construed as any responsibility on our part
        to make good for such penalty or any other amount incurred or suffered
        because of such negligent act on the part of the Passenger. 
        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">>8. PAYMENT</h3>
        METHOD Passengers can affect payment for Transport Services either
        through cards, carrier billing or other payment methods directly
        available in the Chauffeur Cars App, that is, the Payment Method. You
        hereby authorise us to collect on your behalf the Passenger Fees or
        other amounts paid by the Passenger via Payment Method. Any payment
        obligation made by the Passenger via the Payment Method will be
        considered completed as of the time that the payment has been made. The
        possibility for Passenger to pay via the Payment Method may not be
        refused by you and you may not exercise any act to dissuade Passengers
        from using the Payment Method system. We will in such event also reserve
        the right to block your Account, and this without incurring any
        liability whatsoever therefor. The amounts collected through the Payment
        Method system less amounts due to us will be credited to your bank
        account by not later than forty-five (31) days from the date that our
        bank account has been credited. We will not be obliged to pay you any
        Passenger Fees if the Payment Method failed because Passenger’s credit
        card or other payment is cancelled or is unsuccessful for other reasons.
        If you mistake the identity of the Passenger to whom the Transport
        Service was to be provided, we will reimburse the Passenger Fee. We will
        incur no liability whatsoever for the Passenger Fee in such case. We
        reserve the right to impose on you a penalty for every wrongfully
        applied Payment Method effected. We will have the right to set off any
        Passenger Fees due to you via the Payment Method system against amounts
        due to us in terms of this Agreement.
        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5"> 9. FISCAL OBLIGATIONS Any and all</h3> 
        fiscal obligations arising in connection with the provision of the
        Transport Service in relation to this Agreement shall be your sole
        responsibility. Likewise, any obligation relating to income tax, social
        security contribution or other applicable tax or any obligation relative
        to employment shall be your sole responsibility.
        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">10. COMPANY FEES In</h3>

        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5"> 11. RANKING AND PASSENGER REVIEWS</h3>
         In order to guarantee
        highquality service and provide additional reassurance to Passengers,
        you hereby acknowledge that the Passengers may provide you a performance
        rating and leave feedback regarding the quality of the Transport
        Services that you have provided. Your average performance rating will be
        linked to your Account and will be available to Passengers using the
        Chauffeur Cars App. We may also provide you with your activity score. If
        your average performance rating or activity score are below a minimum
        average performance rating and activity score determined by us from time
        to time we may ask you to increase your average performance rating or
        activity score to minimum level within a specific period of time. If
        after such time you will not have so increased your average performance
        rating or activity score, your Account will, after due notification, be
        automatically suspended either temporarily or permanently in our sole
        discretion. We may reverse the suspension of your Account on a
        case-by-case basis.
